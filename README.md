## My process

Grid is still being complicate to me, but i figured out the basics and was able to complete the challenge. Still having to improve a few details, but to be my first time with grid, i think isn't too bad! :)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the basics of CSS grid. Still having to practice and get used to it, but i was great to learn something new! Also i used the CSS position property (never used before) and it was awesome how i recognized that it'd help me in this challenge, so i'm proud that i'm getting better after practicing with the challenges.

### Continued development

I'm quiet happy with the results, but after getting better with Grid i'll come back and optimize the CSS file. Also to set the svg on the bottom right side better, i used margin-top:15%, but still doesn't look exactly as it should, and make the "karma" card the same size as the other ones. For some reason, after relocate it at the bottom it gets a little bit smaller than this other.
